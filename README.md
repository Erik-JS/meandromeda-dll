# ASI Loader for Mass Effect: Andromeda

**Last game version tested:** 1.08 (build 736146)

-----------------------------------------------------------

About ASI loader - original code by listener ([XLiveLess](http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless/))<br />
The ASI loader allows for loading of DLL files without the need of a separate injector. These DLL files must be renamed to *.asi and put in the same folder of the game's executable or in a subfolder named "asi".

-----------------------------------------------------------

**REQUIRED:** how about... nothing? This wasn't compiled under Visual Studio because Microsoft's compiler doesn't support inline ASM for 64-bit.

**DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS 7 OR LATER.**

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Usage:**<br />
- Rename the original DLL file to .bak, then put the new DLL in its place.
