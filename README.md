# ASI Loader for Mass Effect: Andromeda

**Last game version tested:** 1.09 (build 739369)

About ASI loader - original code by listener ([XLiveLess](http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless/))<br />
The ASI loader allows for loading of custom-made DLL files without the need of a separate injector.<br />
Such DLL files must be renamed to *.asi and put in a subfolder named *ASI* inside the game's root folder.<br />
For testing purposes, the ASI loader will, alternatively, load plugins from the root if the *ASI* subfolder is missing or nothing was successfully loaded from there.

**REQUIRED:** how about... nothing? This wasn't compiled under Visual Studio because Microsoft's compiler doesn't support inline ASM for 64-bit.

**DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS 7 OR LATER.**

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Usage:**<br />
- Rename the original DLL file to .bak, then put the new DLL in its place.
